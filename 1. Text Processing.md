# Strings in C/C++
## C-string (null-terminated string)
### Problems
The type of a part of C-string is not a C-string
Time complexity of getting length  is O(n)

## `std::string` in C++11
`std::basic_string`
`std::string` & `std::wstring`

# Operations of c-string and `std::string`
## Finding, counting and simple matching
* Startwith
* Endwith
* Count
* Index
* Find
* Counting
## Partitioning
* By separator
* By pos
## Aggregating
* Join
* Concatenate
## Modification
* Replace
## Comparing
## Generating
## Character category and classification

# Character system and string
String is first-class class in most managed languages because
1. Best performance
2. Good use experience
3. **Character systems**

### Basic knowledge of character system
* Historical standard
	* ASCII
* ISO codepages
	* 8859-1: Latin-1
	* ...
* Windows code pages
	* cp936 (GBK)
	* cp932 (Shift_JIS)
* Unicode
	* Code point
		* ISO/IEC 10646
		* Lower 64k charaters called BMP or UCS-2
			* Most frequently used characters are located in BMP
	* UTFs
		* Variable length coding
		* UTF-1
		* UTF-7
		* UTF-8
		* UTF-16 (BE/LE)
			* Some samples of UTF-16 ![[UTF-16 Sample.png]]
	* UTF-32

### Charater system and C++ `*char*` types
| Char Type  | `string` type | Std      | Char system                | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ----- |
| `char`     | `string`      | < C++11  | UTF-8/SBCS/MBCS            |       |
| `wchar_t`  | `wstring`     | < C++11  | UTF-16(Win)/UTF-32 (Linux) |       |
| `char8_t`  | `u8string`    | >= C++20 | UTF-8                      |       |
| `char16_t` | `u16string`   | >= C++11 | UTF-16                     |       |
| `char32_t` | `u32string`   | >= C++11 | UTF-32                     |       |
## Prefer to use UTF-8
### Why
* Advatages of UTF-8 string
	* Compacted storage
	* Best compatibility
* Disadvantages of UTF-8 string
	* Variable length
		* Hard to implements k-th charater, position based splitting, etc.
		* Storage size of output string cannot be predicted precisely.
### Example
String in python
* [PEP 393 â€“ Flexible String Representation | peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0393/)

# Formatting
## C-style format
`printf`, `sprintf`, `svprintf`, `snprintf`
## C++ standard library
by `sstream`
## New style formatting
std::format (C++20)
[fmtlib/fmt: A modern formatting library (github.com)](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)

# Matching and Parsing
## Matching and parsing a small text
Regular expression
## Pre-defined structural text processsing libraries
Yaml
Json
XML
Proto
xSV (CSV, TSV, etc.)
# Large scale text processing
* C++ may not be the best choice
	* IO might be the bottleneck
	* Consider Python or C#
* Determine the character sets
* Load into memory
* Segmentation and Indexing
	* Isometric segmentations
		* Logging the array of struct
	* Indexed segmentation
		* Sorted
		* Hash mapped
	* Stored in database
		* RDBMS or Non-SQL databases
		* In-process or out-of-process
* Concurrent processing
* Distributed processing
