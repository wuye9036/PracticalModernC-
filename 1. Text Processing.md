# Strings in C/C++
## C-string (null-terminated string)
### Looking back
### Problems
The type of a part of C-string is not a C-string
Time complexity of getting length  is O(n)

## String representation
* C String
* `std::basic_string`, `std::string` & `std::wstring`
* `c_str` and not null-terminated string
* `string_view` (C++17)

## Environments
  * C/C++ (<= C++14) **w/o** 3rd party libraries
  * C/C++ with standard libs
    * C++ 17 `string_view`
    * C++ 20 *ranges*, *format*, `starts_with`, `ends_with`
    * C++ 2b `contains`, `join_with`
  * C/C++ with **quasi-standard libs** (11 or 14 required)
    * *{fmt}*, *range-v3*, *abseil*, *boost*, *folly*
  * C/C++ with 3rd Party Libs

# Operation
## Manipulation
* Construct
* Copy
* Concatenate
* Join
* Split (by *Position* or by *Separator*)
* Trim (a.k.a Strip)
## Examination
* Startwith
* Endwith
* Count
* Index/Find
* Count
* Compare
## Partitioning
* By separator
* By pos
## Generating

# Character sets and string
String is first-class class in most managed languages because
1. Best performance
2. Good use experience
3. **Character set**

## Character sets
* Legacy
	* ASCII
* ISO codepages
	* 8859-1: Latin-1
	* ...
* Windows code pages
	* cp936 (GBK)
	* cp932 (Shift_JIS)
* Unicode
	* Code point
		* ISO/IEC 10646
		* Lower 64k code points called BMP or UCS-2
			* Most frequently used characters are located in BMP
	* UTFs
		* Variable length coding
		* UTF-8
		* UTF-16 (BE/LE)
			* Some samples of UTF-16 ![[UTF-16 Sample.png]]
	* UTF-32

## Charater sets and C++ `*char*` types
| Char Type  | `string` type | Std      | Char system                | Notes |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ----- |
| `char`     | `string`      | < C++11  | UTF-8/SBCS/MBCS            |       |
| `wchar_t`  | `wstring`     | < C++11  | UTF-16(Win)/UTF-32 (Linux) |       |
| `char8_t`  | `u8string`    | >= C++20 | UTF-8                      |       |
| `char16_t` | `u16string`   | >= C++11 | UTF-16                     |       |
| `char32_t` | `u32string`   | >= C++11 | UTF-32                     |       |

## Prefer to use UTF-8
### Why
* Advatages of UTF-8 string
	* Compacted storage
	* Best compatibility
* Disadvantages of UTF-8 string
	* Variable length
		* Hard to implements k-th charater, position based splitting, etc.
		* Storage size of output string cannot be predicted precisely.
### Example
String in python
* [PEP 393 â€“ Flexible String Representation | peps.python.org](https://peps.python.org/pep-0393/)

## Locale & Localization
  * Character classification
  * Conversion between character Sets
  * Digits/Concurrency Format
  * Identical glyphs on different code points
    * NOTE: Unicode doesn't encode glyph
    * Security issue such as IDN Homograph Attack
  * Input and Output
    * Keyboard, IME, output locale, etc.

# Formatting
## C-style format
`printf`, `sprintf`, `svprintf`, `snprintf`
## C++ standard library
by `sstream`
## New style formatting
* std::format (C++20)
* [fmtlib/fmt: A modern formatting library (github.com)](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)

# Matching and Parsing
## Matching and parsing a small amount of text
Regular expression
## Pre-defined structural text processsing libraries
* Yaml
* Json
* XML
* Proto
* xSV (CSV, TSV, etc.)
# Large scale text processing
### < 20GB
* Just bigger than usual
* Versioning
* Validating
* Allowed character set and coding may affects the storage/processing policy
	* English only
	* UCS-2 only
		* UTF-8
		* UTF-16
### 20GB to 1TB
* Large but not-so-large data processing
	* Plain text processing
	* Querying by few keys
	* Querying by relation
	* Mapping to strong typed objects in software (for e.g., Serialization and ORM)
* Stratigies
	* Process by our own tool chain
		* Dividing or sparsing
			* Using file set than one file
		* Indexing the file
			* By physical position
			* By (ordered or hashed) keys
			* Pre-computed values
		* Validating tools
	* Rely on the DB
		* RDBMS
		* Non-SQL databases
		* In-process or out-of-process
	* Concurrent processing
		* Multi-threading or multi-processing
		* Asynchronization
* C++ may not be the best choice
	* IO might be the bottleneck
	* Consider Python or C#
### > 1TB
* Distributed processing
	* e.g. Apache data processing stack
		* Hive/Spark
