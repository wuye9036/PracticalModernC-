# Strings in C++
## C-string (null-terminated string)
### Problems
The type of a part of C-string is not a C-string
No explicit length

## `std::string` in C++11
`std::basic_string`
`std::string` & `std::wstring`

## Operations of `string`
Finding, counting and simple matching
	Startwith
	Endwith
	Count
	Index
	Find
Split
	By separator
	By pos
Aggregation
	Join
	Concatenate
Modification
	Replace
Compare
Counting
Generating
Classfication

# Character system and string
String is first-class class in most managed languages because
1. Best performance
2. Good use experience
3. **Character systems**

### Basic knowledge of character system
* Historical standard
	* ASCII
* ISO codepages
	* 8859-1: Latin-1
	* ...
* Windows code pages
	* cp936 (GBK)
	* cp932 (Shift_JIS)
* Unicode
	* Code point
		* ISO/IEC 10646
		* Lower 64k charaters called BMP or UCS-2
			* Most frequently used characters are located in BMP
	* UTFs
		* Variable length coding
		* UTF-1
		* UTF-7
		* UTF-8
		* UTF-16 (BE/LE)
			* Some samples of UTF-16 ![[UTF-16 Sample.png]]
	* UTF-32

### Charater system and C++ `*char*` types
| Char Type  |  `string` type   | Std      | Char system                | Notes |     |
| ---------- | --- | -------- | -------------------------- | ----- | --- |
| `char`     |  `string`   | < C++11  | UTF-8/SBCS/MBCS            |       |     |
| `wchar_t`  |  `wstring`   | < C++11  | UTF-16(Win)/UTF-32 (Linux) |       |     |
| `char8_t`  |  `u8string`   | >= C++20 | UTF-8                      |       |     |
| `char16_t` |  `u16string`   | >= C++11 | UTF-16                     |       |     |
| `char32_t` |  `u32string`   | >= C++11 | UTF-32                     |       |     |
## Use UTF-8 as much as possible

* Advatages of UTF-8 string
	* Compacted storage
	* Best compatibility
* Disadvantages of UTF-8 string
	* Variable length
		* Hard to implements k-th charater, position based splitting, etc.
		* Storage size of output string cannot be predicted precisely.

# Tips and tricks for large-scale text file processing
* C++ may not be the first choice
	* IO might be the bottleneck
	* Consider Python or C#
* Determine the character sets
* Load into memory
* Segmentation and Indexing
	* Isometric segmentations
		* Logging the array of struct
	* Indexed segmentation
		* Sorted
		* Hash mapped
	* Stored in database
		* RDBMS or Non-SQL databases
		* In-process or out-of-process
* Concurrent processing
* Distributed processing
